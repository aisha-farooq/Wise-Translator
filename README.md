# Wise Translator
### **Sequence-to-Sequence Semantically and Contextually Intellectual Machine Translation from English to Urdu and vice versa**

## About
In this project, we are planning to develop a bi-lingual translation application which will take the text in either Urdu or English, and will provide the concise and relevant translation in other language respectively.

With everything moving towards automation in todayâ€™s world, we saw a gap since there is a dearth of online real-time applications that translate between Urdu and English text except for a few. We plan to develop a web application which will translate Urdu text to English and vice versa. The main use case of this application is to act as a bridge between the two languages. As we are working on the pure concepts of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and we have targeted the two specific languages one is English an international language and other one is Urdu our national language. By our project as there is not sufficient work done on Urdu at academic level or at National level but by this project, there will be a chance and opportunity that people will get help from this and can use our provided API and gathered datasets for their development concerns and with the help of that learning, many people will get served and become able to explore this side of computer science and its applications.

## Objectives 
* To provide a platform for quick translation which is necessary for the spread of knowledge and ideas 
* To lay out an initiative which will help others in future 
* To help subtitle generation and API will help the people to get subtitles easily
* To make Urdu a stand able language because it is our national language which needs to be prevailed

## Implementation Details
### [Understanding the BLEU Score Evaluation Metric](https://cloud.google.com/translate/automl/docs/evaluate#bleu)
BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for automatically evaluating machine-translated text. The BLEU score is a number between zero and one that measures the similarity of the machine-translated text to a set of high quality reference translations. A value of 0 means that the machine-translated output has no overlap with the reference translation (low quality) while a value of 1 means there is perfect overlap with the reference translations (high quality).

It has been shown that BLEU scores correlate well with human judgment of translation quality. Note that even human translators do not achieve a perfect score of 1.0.

## Progress/Results
### English to Urdu Model
* Trained on 2.3 millions parallel sentences dataset for 5 epochs
* BLEU Score achieved approximately 32 

### Urdu to English Model
* Trained on 2.3  of millions parallel sentences dataset for 5 epochs
* BLEU Score achieved approximately 31
